function ddf = ddF(Y,H)
% ddF	Computes the second derivative of F, that is,
% 	ddf = d/dx dF(Y+x*H).

%	ddf = DDF(Y,H)
%	Y is expected to satisfy Y'*Y = I
% 	H is expected to be the same size as Y
%	ddf will be the same size as Y
%
% role	objective function, the function is called to apply the 
%	unconstrained hessian of F to a vector.
